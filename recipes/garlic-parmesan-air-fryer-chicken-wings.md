These crispy air-fryer wings are finished with a buttery, garlicky Parmesan sauce and come together in minutes without needing a vat of oil.

> **Storage**: Wings are best served immediately, but can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

#### Ingredients
- 2 pounds (907 g) whole chicken wings, cut at joints into drumettes and flats
- 3 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 cup (50 g) unsalted butter
- 5 medium garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (2/3 ounce; 20 g), plus more for garnish
- 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
- Ranch dressing and lemon wedges, for serving

#### Method
1. Pat the wings dry with paper towels, toss with baking powder and 2 teaspoons kosher salt, and optionally rest uncovered in the fridge for up to 24 hours.
2. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F (205°C) for 5 minutes, arrange the wings in a single layer with space between them, and cook for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.
3. While the wings cook, microwave butter and garlic in 30-second bursts until bubbling, about 1 minute 30 seconds, stirring between bursts.
4. Stir in Parmesan, parsley, and the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt into the hot butter mixture.
5. Toss the cooked wings with the sauce so every ridge is coated, then transfer to a platter and garnish with extra cheese.

> **Tip:** Serve immediately with ranch dressing and lemon wedges while still hot; batch-cook smaller amounts if your air fryer is compact.

Special equipment: a 6-quart or larger air fryer keeps the wings crisp, but smaller baskets work if you cook in batches.
