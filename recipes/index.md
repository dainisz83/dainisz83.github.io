title: Dining with Dainis & Izabela

Welcome to the cookbook where we capture the dishes we prepare together. Each recipe is stored as Markdown so it stays versioned, searchable, and easy to update. Use the navigation to the left (or the recipe cards on mobile) to jump straight into the latest dish, then edit the Markdown whenever you want to tweak the instructions or add tasting notes.

We process every photo and URL through a staging workflow before it lands in this directory, then deploy the polished site via GitHub Pages—so the live page always matches what you reviewed and approved.
