This lasagna emulates the Serious Eats take on al forno Bolognese—slow-simmered meat sauce, tender sheets, and a touch of béchamel to keep it creamy while the top crisps up.

#### Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, finely diced
- 2 celery stalks, finely diced
- 4 garlic cloves, smashed
- 500 g ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork)
- 150 g pancetta, finely chopped
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 12 lasagna sheets (fresh or dried)
- 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus extra for serving
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella (optional)
- 2 cups béchamel (butter, flour, milk, nutmeg)

#### Method
1. Warm olive oil in a heavy pot, then add onion, carrot, and celery; sweat until soft and translucent. Stir in garlic and toast briefly.
2. Add pancetta and ground meat, breaking it up as it browns. When the meat is fully cooked, deglaze with wine and reduce by half.
3. Stir in milk and simmer until almost absorbed, then add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaf, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper and let the ragù simmer very gently for 45–60 minutes (add water if it gets too thick).
4. Preheat oven to 190 °C (375 °F). Have your béchamel and grated cheeses ready.
5. Layer in a deep baking dish: a slick of béchamel, lasagna sheets, ragù, shredded mozzarella/Parmigiano, repeat until you finish with a final layer of béchamel and a generous dusting of Parmigiano.
6. Bake for 30–35 minutes until golden and bubbling, then rest 15 minutes before slicing so the layers set.

> **Tip:** Save the ragù in the fridge for a day—it develops a deeper flavour and reheats beautifully for leftovers.
