### Why this version
A layered aubergine-and-beef bake inspired by the Guardian’s classic, updated with a quicker bechamel and extra oregano for warmth. Keep it bubbling in the oven while the Greek salad gets assembled.

#### Ingredients
- 2 aubergines, sliced lengthwise
- 400 g minced lamb or beef
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves
- 400 g crushed tomatoes
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup grated kefalotyri or parmesan
- Bechamel (butter, flour, milk, nutmeg)
- Olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano

#### Method
1. Salt the aubergine slices, roast until golden, and pat dry.
2. Brown the meat with onion, garlic, tomato paste, cinnamon, and oregano, then add crushed tomatoes and simmer.
3. Layer aubergines, ragout, and bechamel in a casserole, finish with grated cheese, and bake at 190 °C for 35–40 minutes.
4. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing so the layers settle.

> **Note:** The leftovers taste even better the next day when reheated slowly in the oven.
