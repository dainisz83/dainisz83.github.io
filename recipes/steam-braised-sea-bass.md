A delicate fish dish referenced from Serious Eats—chill the bass in a bamboo steamer, tuck in ginger and scallions, and finish with a splash of ponzu.

#### Ingredients
- 2 sea bass fillets
- 2 slices ginger
- 2 scallions, cut into 3 cm lengths
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- Soy sauce and ponzu to serve
- Optional: a touch of rice wine

#### Method
1. Lay ginger and scallions on the bottom of the steamer, place the sea bass skin-side up, drizzle with sesame oil.
2. Steam for 8–10 minutes (until the flesh flakes), remove, and top with fresh scallion oil.
3. Serve with ponzu or soy, and a side of jasmine rice.

> **Tip:** Reserve the steaming liquid for soup stock—salty, umami-rich base for next day’s broth.
